# ML_Iris_Classification

## Project Description
This uses raw github user content from a csv in order to get a training set of data to work with. Models are train, tested and selected based on model acccuracy using k-fold cross validation.
Results of model accuracy are then visualized, along with data summary.

## Skills Learned
Through this project I was able to familiarize myself with machine learning tools such as sklearn, as well as model evaluation. Through this project, I had also familiarized myself with data visualization using matplotlib.

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn
-scipy

## Installing and Running
This is a simple python script. It can be ran in IDLE or using the command line, given the dependencies are installed.
